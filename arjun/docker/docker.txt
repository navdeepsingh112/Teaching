Microservices  : Fine grain services ( single app is broken into smaller units  , looslely coupled )

Monolithic services : application built as single unified unit 

Converstion from Monolithic Services to Microservices 

Microsoervices :

Pros :

scalable 
faster deployement 
single unit scalable
Fault isolation
easy Mainitainence 
Developer independence 

Cons:

MicroComplexity
Latencey
deployement and versioning challenges
increased security 
higher upfront Cost 



Monolithic :

Pros:

Simple
fast deployement/developement 
easy testing /debugging

Cons:
Non scalable 
complex Mainitainence
difficult to adopt new tech
increase risk of failure
